- [⚙️ Tech-stack](#tech-stack)


- **[React](https://reactjs.org/):** A popular open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components and a virtual DOM, enabling efficient, dynamic single-page and native apps.

- **[React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/en/main):** The go-to routing library for React apps, offering nested routes, data loaders/actions, error boundaries, code splitting, and SSR support—with a smooth upgrade path from v6.

- **[Puter.com](https://puter.com/):** An advanced, open-source internet OS used as a privacy-first personal cloud to keep all your files, apps, and games in one secure place—accessible from anywhere at any time.

- **[Puter.js](https://github.com/puter-project/puter-js):** A tiny client-side SDK that adds serverless auth, storage, database, and AI (GPT, Claude, DALL·E, OCR…) straight into your browser app—no backend needed and costs borne by users.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to design custom user interfaces by applying low-level utility classes directly in HTML, streamlining the design process.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, providing better tooling, code quality, and error detection—ideal for building large-scale applications.

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/):** A fast build tool and dev server using native ES modules for instant startup, hot-module replacement, and Rollup-powered production builds—perfect for modern web development.

- **[Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction):** A minimal, hook-based state management library for React. It lets you manage global state with zero boilerplate, no context providers, and excellent performance through selective state subscriptions.
